## **Types of Computer**

> As per the size and capacity there, are following types of computer

1. **`Micro Computer`**

   Computers Used by individuals and hence are also called personal computers or PC's e.g., Laptops, tablets, desktops etc.

2. **`Mini Computer`**

   This type of computers are comparatively larger and are also 5 to 50 times powerful than that of a micro Computer.

3. **`Main Frame Computer`**

   These are large sized computers. By implementing technologies like time sharing and multi tasking even more than 100 people can work together on such computer. These are generally used for scientific and research based projects.

4. **`Super Computer`**

   These are much more powerful in terms of their storage capacity, efficiency and output ratio. Some examples of SuperComputer are `SAGA 220, Titan, PARAM Anant etc`.

5. **`Quantum computer`**

   This stage of computers is still in its development phase. In such computers binary bits will be replaced with `Q-bit` and their efficiency will be comparable to the **human brain**.

## **Main Components**

The Computer system hardware comprises of four main components : Input/Output (I/O) unit, Central Processing Unit (CPU) and memory unit. The I/O unit consist of the input and output device. The CPU performs calculation and processing on the input data and to generate the output.

### **Input unit**

In Order to provide instructions and data to a computer, the information is supplied to it through an input unit or device.</br>
e.g., Keyboard, Mouse, Light pen, Joy stick, Bar Code Reader (BCR), Smart Card Reader (SCR), Touch Screen, Microphone, Digital Camera, Scanner etc.

### **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

Information and data provided through the input devices is manipulated and processed inside the CPU. CPU is also termed as the **_Brain of Computer_**</br>
It is further divided into two components

- **`Arithmetic and Logic Unit`** (ALU) It is a part of the execution unit, a core component of all CPU's. ALU performs all arithmetic and logic operations. It consists of number of small location, termed as registers.
- **`Control Unit`** It is the part of a CPU that directs its operation. It gives command to transfer data from the input devices to memory and from memory to ALU.

## **Memory**

Memory holds all the raw and processed data, set of instructions and information inside CPU.

## **Primary Memory**

>It is the computer's memory which is accessible directly by the pursuing unit also known as main memory.

- **`RAM`** (Random Access Memory) RAM is the volatile memory that holds the code and data that are actively used by CPU.
- Static RAM (SRAM)
- Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

- **`ROM`** (Read Only Memory) ROM is non-volatile memory and is logical in nature hence, once written cannot be changed. ROM can keep data even without power source.
- Programmable ROM (PROM)
- Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM); Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM)

- **`Cache Memory`** Cache memories are accessed much faster than conventional RAM, It is used to store program or data currently being used on temporary data.

## **Secondary Memory**

It is accessible by the input/output channels of the computer and transfer the desired data. It is non-volatile and does not loses the data when the device is powered down. Some of the example of secondary memory devices are `Hard Disk Drive`, `Floppy Disk`, `Compact Disc (CD)`, `Digital Versatile Disc (DVD)`, `Pen Drive`, `Blue Ray disc` etc.

## **Output Unit**

Output is the result of processing. It displays results to user.</br> e.g., `Monitors`, `Printers`, `Speakers`, `Pen drives plotters` etc.

3. **`Internet`** It is a private utilizing internet type tools, but available only within that organization.

4. **`Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)`** It is designed for telephone, which requires modem for data communication.

5. **Value Added Network (VAN)** It provides Electronic Data interchange (EDI) facility. It subscribe services like in voices, sale-purchase order etc.

6. **`Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN)`** It used for voice, video and data services. It uses digital transmission and it combines both circuit and packet switching.

7. **`Firewall`** It is a combination of software and hardware based devices to permit or deny network transmission based on a set of rules and is frequently used to protect network from unauthorized access while permitting legitimate communication to pass.

8. **`Repeaters`** It is used on a network to regenerate signals to be sent over long distance.

## **Security Threats**

- **`Phishing`** is characterized by attempts to fraudulently acquire sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details etc by masquerading as a trust worthy person.

- **`Computer Worm`** is a self replicating computer program, similar to computer virus. A worm is self contained and does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself.

- **`Spam`** is a abuse of messaging systems to unsolicited, bulk messages ina form of e-mail.

- **`Mobile Phone Spam`** It is directed at the text messaging service of a mobile phone. This can be especially irritating to customers not only for the inconvenience but also because they sometimes have to pay to receive such spam messages. Kaspersky lab, the russian cyber security firm has recently revealed that india is among various nations which are hit by the cyber spying campaign termed as *'Red October'*.
